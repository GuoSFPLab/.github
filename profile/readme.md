Welcome to the Github homepage of the [Subsurface Flow Physics Lab](https://guolab.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona. Our group is under the direction of Dr. Bo Guo, an associate professor in the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences and affiliated faculty of the Graduate Program in Applied Math. We study the fundamental physics of fluid flow and transport in Earth's subsurface. We develop and use novel mathematical and computational models to understand and quantify flow and transport processes in geological porous materials across a wide range of spatial scales from microscale (i.e., pore scale) to laboratory scale and to real-world subsurface environmental and energy problems at the field scale.

While we focus on computational modeling, we also frequently collaborate with experimentalists to utilize laboratory measured parameters and field data sets to drive the models and validate our predictions. Specific application areas of our research include contaminant transport in soil and groundwater especially emerging contaminants such as PFAS, shale gas/oil production, and geological CO2 sequestration. Our research is funded by National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and American Chemical Society Petroleumn Research Fund.
